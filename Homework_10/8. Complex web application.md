**8. Complex web application**



**Project goal:** deploy a web application on port 5000 that displays “Hello World” in the browser.



As a base, I used the Heroku Node.js demo project, which has a dependency on the Express framework.

The Docker image is built using a multi-stage approach:

**Builder stage** — a heavier image that contains Git, Node.js and npm.

It clones the repository and installs all application dependencies.

**Runtime stage** — a lightweight image that includes only Node.js and the compiled application files.



To optimize the final image size, I used the --no-cache option with apk, preventing package caching inside layers.



\# Builder

FROM alpine:latest AS builder

WORKDIR /app

RUN apk update \&\& apk add git nodejs npm

RUN git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample.git

WORKDIR /app/node-js-sample

RUN npm install



\# Runtime

FROM alpine:latest AS runtime

RUN apk update \&\& apk add --no-cache nodejs

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/node-js-sample /app

EXPOSE 5000

CMD \["node", "index.js"]
