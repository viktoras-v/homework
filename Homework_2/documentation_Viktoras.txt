Structure:
As expected from best practices, I see Getting Started, Installation, and Using Ansible sections in the left column.
Each of these has a sub-menu, and after the Introduction we jump directly to creating playbooks. Nice — straight to hands-on!
The left column gives convenient navigation.
However, the most important part of Ansible — the modules — is not easy to find. It’s hidden in Reference & Appendices. Not nice at all!
Let’s forgive this inconvenience, though, because the Search box at the top compensates for it.
Let’s examine the Installation topic. You just scroll to your installation method and that’s it — copy/paste the command.
Overall, a neutral evaluation of the menu.

Best Practices:
Every module provides examples of use, which are best practices by themselves.
Positive evaluation.

Troubleshooting:
I was unable to find troubleshooting information on installation or configuration.
Hopefully, it’s impossible to screw up the installation :)
Negative evaluation.

Understanding:
Very easy to read and understand. The font is clear and the content is well written.
Positive evaluation.

2.
Welcome to the Database Backup Bash Script documentation (DBBS):

Assume I will store it on GitHub, though the main source of documentation will be the README file.
I will keep it simple.

About
As briefly as possible, I will describe my product and its main features.

Installation
Step-by-step installation scenarios for supported operating systems.

Configuration
A list of variables and parameters — from the most important to the less critical ones.

Usage
A comprehensive guide on how to use my new tool.

Examples
This is the last, but most important part.
Most users will come here looking for ready-to-use scenarios, so let’s give them plenty of those!
